Analysis of determinants that influence rural-urban migration

This repository shows us a small scale version of migration of population from outer region of urban city to the city itself based on various factors which influence the decision of a person to migrate.

Cellular Automata model have been used to visualize the migration with Moore's nearest neighbour algorithm.
